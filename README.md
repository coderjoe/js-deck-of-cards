A javascript deck of cards
--------------------------

The purpose of this is to write a javascript deck of cards supporting two things:

*  A method called shuffle to shuffle the deck
*  A method called deal to deal an arbitrary number of cards

Some quick notes
----------------

1.  Decks make use of cards.
2.  Cards have a value and name (optionally a suit).
3.  Deck types can be created with a helper or by individually defining cards.
4.  Shuffle methods are provided separately. (No default shuffle is provided)
